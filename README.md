Card flipping memory game with two levels

This is a memory game that starts off with 12 blank cards on the first level, and has 20 cards on the second level. The goal is to click on one card, see what image it flips to, and then find its matching card. If you click the same image twice, you will get an alert telling you. When you receive a match, you will also receive an alert. Finally, the score is kept for how many matches you get until you win the level.
